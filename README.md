# Problem Statement we are working on
Personalize course as per students current knowledge level and learning capacity
"One size does not fit for all", we all know this, but when it comes to education we try and fit the same course for all the
students. Learning can be made much better if the course is personalized as per the student's knowledge level. So you need to
build a solution that detects students' knowledge level and personalize course accordingly.
