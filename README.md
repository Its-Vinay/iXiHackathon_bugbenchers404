# Problem Statement we are working on
Personalize course as per students current knowledge level and learning capacity
"One size does not fit for all", we all know this, but when it comes to education we try and fit the same course for all the
students. Learning can be made much better if the course is personalized as per the student's knowledge level. So you need to
build a solution that detects students' knowledge level and personalize course accordingly.
# Solution we are providing :
-We are basically building a platform to personalise study material and tutorials as per the student's caliber.
-There would be a search bar that would lead to video tutorials and text/notes of that particular topic. After that a short   test would be conducted that will evaluate the user's skills to know the area of improvement and their subject of interest.
-If the user get stuck in a question during the test then a hint would be generated that will provide with the link to explore that topic.Every time different hint would be generated for the same question.
-On the basis of hint count for particular questions,user's weak,intermediate and strong subjects would be displayed.Then weak points will be focused more and level of strong subject would be increased to learn efficiently and a more personalised environment can be created. 
-Regular gamified activities are also included to make this platform interesting and attractive.After each game, the user will be given tasks to complete that much topic or score that much points in test to play again.
